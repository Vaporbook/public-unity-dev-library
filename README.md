# public-unity-dev-library

A public place to store my Unity tools, assets, and script libraries

I currently import this into Unity via the github package url. In your `<project-dir>/Packages/manifest.json` file you can add the line `"vaporbook.unity-tools": "git@github.com:Vaporbook/public-unity-dev-library.git"` to your dependencies.
